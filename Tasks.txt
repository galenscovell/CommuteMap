    * Send in a location and destination, return average commute time by bus for a given arrival time
    * Send in multiple locations and a single destination, return the above per location
    * Send in a location and multiple destinations, return the above per destination
2) Create heatmap

    * Place labeled points on map for each location/destination based on coordinates
    * Color points based on commute time
    * Color regions around points based on region area
