# CommuteMap
Generates commute map to find reasonable places to live

Goal was to generate a heatmap of every searched location showing you which areas are too far away to live in, commute wise.
Takes in either multiple origins or multiple destinations for coming and going from work.

Built over a hackday -- code ain't pretty and ultimate goal of a beautiful heatmap wasn't reached, but it does work.

Realized halfway through I would've been much better off making it in Scala like some of my other vis tools, since python gui stuff is a mess.
